 ### Origin of My Gaming 
<body> Since I was 7 years old, I've been a gamer. From trying to sneak on my brothers computer to play overwatch, to hitting immortal 3 in valorant. I think that games have been a big part of my life. Since gaming has been such a big part of my life, I would like to commemorate all of my best gaming moments by putting my clips in the best montage of all time. </body>
