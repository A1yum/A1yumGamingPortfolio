 ### Origin of My Gaming 
<body> Since I was 7 years old, I've been a gamer. From trying to sneak on my brothers computer to play overwatch, to hitting immortal 3 in valorant. I think that games have been a big part of my life. Since gaming has been such a big part of my life, I would like to commemorate all of my best gaming achievements. </body>

<h1> Valorant </h1>
<body> Valorant was a gmae that I used to adore. it was my main videogame from 2020 to 2023. One of my best acheivements was being able to hitting immortal 3 and ranked #3000 in North America. </body>

<body> Another Acheivement was my kill record in valorant in one game. This happened in a casual game with my friends. I was able to kill 50 people in a single game. Pretty Good Right? </body>

<h2> Fortnite</h2>
<body> Fortnite was one of my favorite games grwoing up. I have been playing since early 2018 and have been playing ever since. I stopped playing a lot around 2019, but I got back into it mid quarantine. Some of my best Fortnite moments were streamsniping Valkyrae. She was my favorite streamer and I was able to troll her in a game of Fortnite. Also, another one of my best acheivements was being the Highest Ranked back in Chapter 2, Season 1. I believe that the ranking system was called Arena and I was in the champions division.</body>

<h4> Next we have Overwatch and I used to play this game when it originally came out and this was actually one of the first shooter games that I was into. The highest rank that I was able to get in the regular ranked mode was diamond, but in other speacial gamemodes I was able to get higher.</h4>
